# XGBoost-and-Random-Forest-for-Time-Series

Estimating a storeâ€™s revenues and losses for a given period is made easier by forecasting total sales and customer numbers in-store. Manual estimation may be challenging because certain days may differ owing to weather conditions and other factors that may have an effect on the retail industry. This project presents Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest regressor decision tree methods for projecting the number of customers in-store at a certain hour and the sales made during that hour. The two models presented in this study show that the XGBoost is the best model for forecasting sales, while the Random Forest regressor is the best model for forecasting store traffic. These forecasting models can be used interchangeably by the store to forecast future sales and the number of customers in the store for various management reasons, such as estimating monthly profit or forecasting the number of people for holidays to hire enough staff, while keeping in mind that for a better forecast of sales, XGBoost is the preferred model, and for traffic, Random Forest is the preferred model.
